# Getting-cleaning_data
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The data are collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.

This repository contains the following files:
* README.md, this file provides an overview of the data set and how it was created.
* cleandata.txt, this txt file is the output of the run_analysis.R, which is the tidy data.
* CodeBook.md, this file describes the variables, the data, and any transformation or work that was perfomed to clean up the data.
* run_analysis.R, this is the R script to clean up the raw data.

## Cleaning data process
* Download zip file and upzip it.
* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the dataset.
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
* From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with average of each variable for each activity and each project.
